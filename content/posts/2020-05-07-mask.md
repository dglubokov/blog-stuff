I will use terms such as universals, lists, and masks very often. The author of such a triad, as I understand it now, is [Roman Mikhailov](https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&query=Mikhailov%2C+R).

Universals are something that cannot be defined in any way, no matter how hard you strive, it is something that cannot be described. These can be various concepts, for example: metaphysics, being, etc. Roman Mikhailov in Heideger's reading ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQh5d3aPuAU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQh5d3aPuAU)) talks about this.

Masks are what people use to work with universals. This is very similar to the idea of ​​a term as a wrapper for some concept, but a term is a word, and a mask is some big description, and not just a concept, but anything elusive.

Lists are what people use to nail universals to practice. Classification, clustering, ordering, fixing are all lists that are a form of masks.
