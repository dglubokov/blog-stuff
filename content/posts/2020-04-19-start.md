This is not my first attempt to start a blog / channel in which I would write something (for example this [telegram chanel](https://t.me/writingdmitry)).
This time I approached everything in a more organized manner and I think that in the near and long time I will fix my thoughts / ideas / notes. The blog itself will be run in [bliki](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/WhatIsaBliki.html) format. I think this is the best option for me.

If we talk about what the bliki consists of, then this is of course the feed itself, sorted by date of writing + separated wiki pages that contain a collection of various best or state-of-the-art practices (like [ailev](https://ailev.livejournal.com/)).
The bliki may become outdated and may be inaccurate / incorrect, but I will try to edit and add new updated information there frequently.
